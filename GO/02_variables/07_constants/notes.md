# CONSTANTS

Constants are declared with the `const` keyword. They can't use the `:=` short declaration syntax.

    const pi = 3.14159

Constants can be character, string, boolean, or numeric values. They _can not_ be more complex types like slices, maps and structs.

As the name implies, the value of a constant can't be changed after it has been declared.
