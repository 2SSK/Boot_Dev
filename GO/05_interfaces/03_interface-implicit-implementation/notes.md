# INTERFACE ARE IMPLEMENTED IMPLICITLY

A type implemented an interface by implementing its methods. Unlike in many other languages, there is no explicit declaration of intent, there is no "implements" keyword.

Implicit interfaces _decouple_ the definition of an interface from its implementation. you may add methods to a type and in the process be unknowingly impelmenting various interfaces, and _that's okay_.
