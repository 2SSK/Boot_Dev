The very first step of any project is to create a repository. A Git "repository" (or "repo") represents a single project. You'll typically have one reopository for each porject you work on.

A repo is essentially just a directory that contains a project (other directories and files). The only differnece is that it _also_ contains a hidden `.git` directory. That hidden directory is where Git stores all of its internal tracking and versioning information for the project.
