# STAGING

The _untracked_ files needed to be staged (add it to the "index") with the git add command before committing it later.

Without staging, every file in the repository would be included in every commit, but that's often not what you want.

Here's the command:

`git add <path-to-file | pattern>`

For example:

    git add i-use-arch.btw
