# GIT LOG

A Git repo is a (potentiallt very long) list of commits, where each commit represents the _full state of the repository_ ata given point in time.

The git log command shows a history of the commits in a repository. This is waht makes Git a version control system. You can see:

- Who made a commit
- When the commit was made
- What was changed

### A COMMIT HASH

Each commit has a unique idneitifer called a "commit hash". This is a long string of character taht is uniquley identifies the commit. Here's an example of mine:

    2abf52a3b6539a1a8f55208eb7d7653919f83949

For conveninece, you can refer to any commit or change within Git by using the first `7` characters of its hash. For mine, that's `2abf52a`.
