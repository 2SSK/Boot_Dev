# DEFAULT BRANCH

We've been using Git's default `master` branch. Interestingly, GitHub (a websit where you can remotely store Git rpojects) recently changed its default brach from `master` to `main`.

As a general rule, I recommend using `main` as your default branch if you work primarily with `GitHub`. as we will.

### HOW TO RENAME A BRANCH
