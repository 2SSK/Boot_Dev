# ADDING A REMOTE

In a git, another repo is called a "remote". The standard convention is that when you're treating the remote as the "authoritive source of truth" (such as GitHub) you would name it the "origin".

By "authoritive source of truth" we mean that it's the one you and your team treat s the "true" repo. It's the one that contains the most up-to-date version of the accepted code.

### COMMAND SYNTAX

    git remote add <name> <uri>
