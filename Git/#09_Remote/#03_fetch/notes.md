Adding a remote to our Git repo does _not_ mean that we automagically have all the conents of the remote. First, we need to <span style="color:blue">fetch </span> the contents.

### COMMAND

    git fetch

This downloads copies of all the contents of the `.git/objects` directory (and other book-keeping information) from the remote repository into your current one.
