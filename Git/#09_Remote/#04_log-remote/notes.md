# LOG REMOTE

The `git log` command isn't only useful for your _local_ repo. You can log the commits of remote repo as well.

    git log remote/branch

For example, if you wanted to see the commits of a branch named `primeagen` from a remote named `origin`, you would run:

    git log origin/primeagen
