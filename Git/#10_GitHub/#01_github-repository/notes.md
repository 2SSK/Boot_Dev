# GITHUB REPOSITORY

<span style="color:blue">GitHub</span> is the most popular website for Git repositories (projects) online. That is, for hosting "remotes" on a central website. GitHub serves several purposes:

- As a backup of all your code on the cloud in case something happens to your computer
- As a central place to share your code nad collaborate on it with others
- As a public protfolio for your coding projects

### GIT != GITHUB

It's inportant to understand that Git and GitHub are _not the same_! Git is an open-source command line tool for managing code files. GitHub and its primary competitors,<span style="color:blue">GitLab</span> and <span style="color:blue">Bitbucket</span>, are commercial web products that _use_ Git. Their websites give us a way to store our code that's managed by Git.
