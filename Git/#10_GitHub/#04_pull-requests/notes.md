On GitHub, a <span style="color:blue">pull request</span> is a way to propose some changes. It's very common to use pull requests if you wnat to make changes to an open source porject, or if you're working on a team.

Pull requests allow team members to see what changes are being proposed and to discuss them before they are merged into the main codebase.
