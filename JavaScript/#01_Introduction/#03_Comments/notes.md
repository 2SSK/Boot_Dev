# JAVASCRIPT COMMENTS

Like in other languages, comments are non-executable text in your code, as a note or reminder to yourself and other developers. Comments are simply a form of documentation.

Comments are ignored by the JavaScript interpreter when your code runs.

    // this code prints a greeting
    console.log('Hello, world!'); // you can also use comments inline

The syntax for comments in JavaScript is `//` for single-line comments and `/* */` for multi-line comments.

    // single-line comment
    /* multi-line
    comment */
