# LINES ENDING WITH SEMI-COLONS IN JS

In languages like C, C++ and java, a semicolon is used as a terminator in various statements. For example, in JavaScript:

    consloe.log('Hello, world!');

Notice the `;` at the end of the line. In JavaScript, semicolons are optional as a terminating character. Deciding whether or not to use them is up to you or the team you're working on.
