# NUMBERS IN JS

In Python, numbers without a decimal part are called `Integers` and farctions are `Floats`. Contrast this to JavaScript where all numbers are just a `number` type.

You're already familiar with the `number` type. Numbers aren't surrounded by quotes when created, but they can have decimal and negative signs.

    let x = 5

    let x = 5.2

    let x = -5

# NUMBERS REVIEW

Remember, in JavaScript all numbers are just "number" types. There is no distinction between "Float" types and "Integers" types.

### ADDITION

    2 + 1
    // 3

### SUBTRACTION

    2 - 1
    // 1

### MULTIPLICATION

    2 * 2
    // 4

### DIVISION

    3 / 2
    // 1.5 (still just a "number")
