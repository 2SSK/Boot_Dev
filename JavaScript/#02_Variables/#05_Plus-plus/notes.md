# PLUS PLUS

In Python, to increment a variable we hada to use the `+=` operator. That operator works in JavaaScript too, but JS also has a `++` operator for when you only want to increment by `1`.

    let starRating = 4

    starRating += 1
    // starRating is now 5

    starRating++
    // starRating is now 6

    starRating += 4
    // starRating is now 10

### FUN FACT

The joke regarding the name of the language C++ is that C++ is "one version better" than straight C.
