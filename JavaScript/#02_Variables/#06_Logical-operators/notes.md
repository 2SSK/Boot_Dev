# LOGICAL OPERATORS

In Python the logical operators were simply their English names:

- `and`
- `or`
- `not`

In JavaScript the equivalent operators have symbols:

- `&&` (and)
- `||` (or)
- `!` (not)

The `&&` operator will only return `true` if _both_ conditions are `true`.

The `||` operator will return `true` if _either_ conditions are `true`.

The `!` operator returns `true` only if the input is `false`.
