# RUNNING NODE.JS

You've been able to run Python code locally by installing the Python interpreter and then running:

    python main.py

Similarly, if you install Node.js on your local machine, you'll be able to run

    node main.js

Node.js is basically the JS equivalent to the `Python` nterpreter.
Before Node, the only way to run JavaScript code was in the browser. You can still do that from scratch as well using <span style="color: blue">your browser's dev tools!</span>

### NVM

I highly recommend using <span style="color:blue">"Node Version Manager"</span> to manage your Node.js installation. NVM makes it easy to:

- Install multiple versions of Node
- Update your Node version
- Keep your Node version configurations separate on a per-project basis
