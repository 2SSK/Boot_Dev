# WEBI

There is one more package manager (actually more of an anti-package manager) **<span style="color:violet">Webi</span>**. Also known as webinstall.dev.

Webi lets you install command line tools directly from the web, with no need for a local command line tool lie **apt** or **brew**. You don't need to install webi itself at all, instead, you just run a shell command that downloads and runs the tool's official installer script.
