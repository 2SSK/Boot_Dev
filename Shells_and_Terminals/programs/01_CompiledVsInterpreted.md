# COMPILED VS INTERPRETED

    - A program is just a set of instructions that a computer can execute.
    - The words "program" and "executable" are often used interchangeably.
    - There are two types of programs:
        * Compiled programs
        * Interpreted programs

## COMPILED PROGRAMS

    A compiled program is a program that has been converted from human-readable source code into machine code (binary).
    - Machine code is a set of instructions that a computer can execute directly.
    - Your computer's CPU is hardware that's been designed to execute machine code.
    - Programming languages like Go, C, and Rust are compiled languages that produce compiled programs.

## INTERPRETED PROGRAMS

    An interpreted program is a program that is executed by another program.
    - The program that executes interpreted program is called an "interpreter".
    - The interpreter reads the source code of the interpreted program and executes it.
    - Programming languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, are interpreted languages.
    - Your computer needs to have an interpreter instlled to run programs written in those languages.
    - Another example is the '.sh' shell script files we talked about. Those are interpreted by the shell program.
