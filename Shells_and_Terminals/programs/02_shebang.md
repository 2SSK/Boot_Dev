# SHEBANG

    You can run any executable file by typing its file path into your shell.
    For example: `bin/gendis.sh`

    But for the scripts that need to be interpreted by another program? The computer needs to be told what program to use to interpret the file.

    A "shebang" is a special line at the top of a script that tells your shell which program to use to execute the file.
    `#! interpreter [optional-arg]`
