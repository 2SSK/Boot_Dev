# BOURNE SHELL

    There are three types of shells we usually encounter:
        1. sh:
            - The Bourne shell.
            - This is the original Unix shell and is POSIX-compliant.
            - It's very basic and doesn't have many quality-of-life features.

        2. bash:
            - The Bourne Again shell.
            - This is the most popular shell on Linux.
            - It builds on `sh`, but also has a lot of extra features.

        3. zsh:
            - The Z shell.
            - This is the most popular shell on macOS.
            - Like `bash`, it does what `sh` can do, but also has a lot of extra features.

_Both zsh and bash are "sh-compatible" shells, meaning they can run .sh scripts, but they also have extra features that generally make them more pleasant to use._
