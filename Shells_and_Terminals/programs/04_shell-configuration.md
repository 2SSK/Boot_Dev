# SHELL CONFIGURATION

    Bash and zsh both have "configuration" files that run automatically each time you start a new shell session.
    These files are used to set up your shell environment. They can be used to set up aliases, funcitons, and environment variables.

    These files are located in your home directory(~) and are hidden by default. The ls command command has a '-a' flag that will show hidden files:
        (ls -a ~)
        - If you're using Bash, .bashrc is probably the file you want to edit.
        - If you're using zsh, .zshrc is probably the file you want to edit.
