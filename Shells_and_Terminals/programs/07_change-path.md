# CHANGE YOUR PATH

A common problem you'll run into in the future is that you install a new program on your machine, but when you try to run it from your terminal, you get an error like:

    $ my-new-program
    -bash: my-new-program: command not found

Nine times out of ten, this is because the program is installed in a location that's not in your **PATH** variable. Oftentimes when you install a program using the CLI, it will print a message during the installation process that tells you where the command was installed.
**_Don't let your eyes glaze over when your terminal prints important message!_**
