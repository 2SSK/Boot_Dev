# PATH CONFIG

If you chaged your **PATH** variable for your current shell session. Trouble is, the next time you restrat your shell, it will be reset to its default value. You won't be able to use the **worldbanc** CLI Tool from anywhere unless you change your **PATH** variable _permanently_.

The most common way to do this is to add the same **export** command to your shell's configuration file.
